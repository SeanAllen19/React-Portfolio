  ## Description

  My task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. 

  Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
